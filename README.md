# C++ Game of 15

This project is a console-based implementation of the classic sliding tile puzzle game known as the "Game of 15" or "15 Puzzle" using C++. It provides an interactive and challenging gaming experience where players aim to arrange numbered tiles in ascending order by sliding them into an empty space on a grid.

## Features

- Game Mechanics: The C++ Game of 15 faithfully replicates the rules and mechanics of the original puzzle game. Players can move tiles within the grid by sliding them into the adjacent empty space. The objective is to arrange the tiles in numerical order, starting from 1 in the top-left corner, and ending with an empty space in the bottom-right corner.

- Console Interface: The game features a console-based interface that allows players to interact with the puzzle grid. The grid and tiles are displayed on the console, and players can input commands to move the tiles (e.g., 'W' for up, 'A' for left, 'S' for down, 'D' for right).

- Randomized Initial Configuration: The initial configuration of the tiles is randomized, providing a different puzzle arrangement for each game. This ensures a unique and challenging experience with every playthrough.

- Valid Move Validation: The game validates player moves to ensure they are valid according to the rules of the puzzle. Invalid moves are rejected, preventing players from making impossible or disallowed tile movements.

- Win Condition Check: The game checks for the win condition after each move, determining if the tiles are arranged in the correct order. If the player successfully solves the puzzle, a victory message is displayed, signaling the completion of the game.

## How to Play

To play the C++ Game of 15, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.

2. Open the project in a C++ development environment, such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

3. Build and compile the source code.

4. Run the compiled executable.

5. The game will display the initial grid configuration in the console.

6. Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys to move the tiles in the corresponding directions. Try to arrange the tiles in numerical order.

7. Continue moving tiles until you successfully solve the puzzle and achieve the desired arrangement.

8. The game will display a victory message upon successful completion.
